# Contents

-  `Password Strength Evaluation Report.docx`: Full documentation of the task, including methodology, analysis, screenshots, and recommendations.

# Key Highlights

# Evaluation Methodology
- Tested passwords of varying length and complexity using **Passwordmeter.com**
- Analyzed password composition and estimated crack time

# Security Findings
- Passwords under 8 characters are extremely vulnerable
- Longer, more diverse passwords (12+ characters) significantly increase security
- Randomness and use of symbols offer the best resistance to attacks

# Common Password Attacks
- Brute Force: Tries all possible combinations; countered by long passwords
- Dictionary Attack: Uses a list of common passwords; countered by non-dictionary words
# Recommendations
- Use passwords with 12+ characters, mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Prefer passphrases or mnemonics for memorability
- Use password managers (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password)
- Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
